# shooter
This game is called shooter. It is a game made by Tuong Nguyen using python (pygame library). There will be asteroids, aliens, and a rocket. The 
rocket is the user.The rocket can shoot bullets at aliens, but not asteroids. If they don't shoot 10 aliens, they die. If they get hit by an asteroid 
or alien, they also die. They only win if they kill 15 aliens. Each game, the user has 3 lives. There will only be 3 ammos at the start and it reloads 
one ammo every 3 seconds. This game is very challenging. Have fun playing with it!
